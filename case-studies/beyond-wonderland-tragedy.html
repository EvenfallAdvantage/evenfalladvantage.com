                <strong>Location:</strong> Gorge Amphitheatre, George, Washington<br>
                <strong>Event:</strong> Beyond Wonderland Pacific Northwest (PNW) Festival<br>
                <strong>Prepared by:</strong> James "Fergie" Ferguson<br>
                <strong>Last Updated:</strong> March 31, 2025</p>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>On June 17, 2023, the Beyond Wonderland Pacific Northwest (PNW) Festival, an electronic dance music (EDM) event at the Gorge Amphitheatre in George, Washington, was disrupted by a mass shooting in its overflow campground. James M. Kelly, a 26-year-old active-duty U.S. Army soldier, opened fire, killing two attendees—Brandy Escamilla (29) and Josilyn Ruiz (26), an engaged couple from Seattle—and injuring three others, including his girlfriend and a security guard. Kelly, who claimed he was hallucinating on psychedelic mushrooms, was shot by police and apprehended. The incident, occurring on the festival's first night, led to the cancellation of Day 2, affecting over 25,000 attendees. This tragedy exposed vulnerabilities in campsite security, emergency coordination, and threat detection, offering critical lessons for unarmed event security personnel.</p>
                <p>This case study examines the incident through the lens of unarmed security, identifying key failures and providing actionable insights to enhance training and preparedness for similar scenarios.</p>
                
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p><strong>Event Details:</strong> Beyond Wonderland PNW, organized by Insomniac Events, is a two-day EDM festival held annually at the Gorge Amphitheatre, a scenic venue 150 miles east of Seattle. The 2023 event featured artists like Kx5, Dillon Francis, and Sub Focus, drawing around 25,000 attendees, many camping on-site.</p>
                <p><strong>Security Staffing:</strong> Approximately 300–400 security personnel from Crowd Management Services (CMS) were deployed, primarily unarmed, alongside 59 officers from multiple agencies, including the Grant County Sheriff's Office (GCSO) and Moses Lake Police Department. Unarmed guards focused on crowd control and entry screening.</p>
                <p><strong>Historical Context:</strong> The Gorge had hosted Beyond Wonderland since 2015 without prior shootings, though minor incidents (e.g., drug overdoses) were noted. Mass shootings at U.S. events, like Route 91 Harvest (2017), had heightened industry awareness of such risks.</p>
                
                <h2>Timeline of Events</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pre-Event (June 16):</strong> Kelly arrived with his girlfriend, Lily Luksich, setting up in the overflow campground, half a mile from the main venue. He consumed mushrooms, later claiming apocalyptic hallucinations.</li>
                    <li><strong>8:20 PM (June 17):</strong> Kelly retrieved a handgun from his truck, returned to the campground, and began firing randomly. Escamilla and Ruiz were killed instantly; Luksich, August Morningstar (31), and an unnamed guard were injured.</li>
                    <li><strong>8:25 PM:</strong> GCSO received shots-fired reports. An "active shooter" alert was issued via Facebook, advising "run, hide, or fight." Kelly fled into a field, continuing to shoot.</li>
                    <li><strong>8:30–8:40 PM:</strong> A Moses Lake detective shot Kelly, who was apprehended and hospitalized. The festival continued inside the venue, with organizers tweeting at 10:00 PM that there was "no current danger."</li>
                    <li><strong>June 18:</strong> Day 2 was canceled, with attendees urged to "rest and take care of yourselves." Kelly faced charges of murder and assault.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aftermath:</strong> Investigations continued into 2024, with lawsuits filed against Live Nation alleging lax weapons and drug policies.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Key Failures in Security and Event Management</h2>
                <h3>Inadequate Training for External Threats:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unarmed guards were trained primarily for internal issues (e.g., crowd control, intoxication), not active shooter scenarios or campsite-specific risks like armed attendees.</li>
                    <li>No evidence of briefings on recognizing erratic behavior (e.g., drug-induced psychosis) or coordinating with law enforcement on external threats.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Weak Campsite Security Measures:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The overflow campground, furthest from the venue, lacked thorough vehicle checks or patrols. Kelly accessed his gun without detection, bypassing main entry screening.</li>
                    <li>Perimeter fencing and barricades were insufficient to deter unauthorized access or secure weapons.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Communication Delays and Confusion:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unarmed guards lacked radios or direct links to police, relying on slow verbal relays or personal phones. This delayed threat reporting and response escalation.</li>
                    <li>Attendees received vague updates (e.g., "incident handled") rather than clear evacuation instructions, causing confusion.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Understaffing for Campsite Oversight:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>With a guard-to-attendee ratio of roughly 1:62–83, security was concentrated at the venue, leaving campsites under-monitored. The overflow area was particularly neglected.</li>
                    <li>Medical teams (number unspecified) were unprepared for a mass casualty event outside the main grounds.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Delayed Incident Recognition and Action:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The festival continued for hours post-shooting at law enforcement's request, prioritizing crowd stability over immediate lockdown or cancellation. This risked further chaos if the threat persisted.</li>
                    <li>Unarmed guards had no authority or training to stop the event or guide evacuations effectively.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Human Toll:</strong> Two deaths, three injuries (including Kelly), and widespread trauma among attendees and staff.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Consequences:</strong> Kelly pleaded not guilty to two counts of first-degree murder and three assault charges in July 2023, with a trial set for August 2025. Families sued Live Nation and the Gorge, alleging negligence; a 2024 ruling is pending appeal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Industry Fallout:</strong> Enhanced security (e.g., thorough searches) was implemented for 2024, with wait times increasing. The tragedy fueled debates over festival safety and Live Nation's practices.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Lessons for Unarmed Event Security</h2>
                <h3>Broadened Threat Training:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Train for active shooter scenarios, drug-related psychosis, and campsite hazards. Include drills on identifying gunfire and guiding evacuations.</li>
                    <li>Brief guards on venue layout, including remote areas like overflow campgrounds, and potential external risks.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Enhanced Campsite Vigilance:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Patrol campgrounds regularly, checking for weapons, suspicious behavior, or unsecured vehicles. Report anomalies (e.g., erratic individuals) immediately.</li>
                    <li>Advocate for stricter entry screening (e.g., all vehicles searched) and weapons bans enforcement.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <blockquote>Security planning must be holistic, addressing not only the main venue but all areas where attendees gather. In today's environment, active threat response capabilities are no longer optional for event planners.</blockquote>
                
                <h2>Recommendations for Event Organizers</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Threat Assessment:</strong> Include campsite-specific risks (e.g., weapons, drugs) in planning, collaborating with police for perimeter patrols.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security Standards:</strong> Increase unarmed guard presence in campgrounds (e.g., 1:50 ratio) and mandate thorough vehicle searches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Venue Safety:</strong> Enhance campsite fencing and lighting, ensuring all areas are monitored. Ban firearms explicitly with signage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Emergency Protocols:</strong> Define clear show-stop triggers and ensure guards can initiate them. Communicate threats transparently to attendees.</li>
                    <li><strong>Robust Communication Systems:</strong> Equip all guards with radios linked to supervisors and police, ensuring real-time threat reporting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Emergency Readiness:</strong> Train staff in basic first aid and crowd management to support responders in mass casualty events.</li>
                </ul>
